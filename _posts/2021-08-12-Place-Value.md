The first beta release of my place value visualizer has been released!

This is a tool that uses unit blocks to represent different values in a base ten system.

The web version is available [here](/place-value/), or the desktop Windows 10/11 version is downloadable [here](https://github.com/J051333/place-value/releases/tag/Beta).

This tool was designed for three purposes:
 - My final semester project
 - To replace a no-longer functioning Flash app for Deer Valley
 - As my submission to the Alabama Governor's App Challenge.

This tool was designed for Deer Valley Elementary School, but is open to use by anyone! The code is public on the [GitHub](https://github.com/J051333/place-value/tree/main/Code).
